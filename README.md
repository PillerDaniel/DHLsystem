# DHLsystem

## Project Overview

DHLsystem is a fictional administrative system implemented as a WPF project using C#. The project includes a four-table database designed to manage users, vehicles, employees, and vehicle assignments.

### Navigation

After logging in, the home screen appears. Use the menu on the left to navigate:
- **Vehicles**: Manage vehicle data
- **Employees**: Manage employee data
- **Selected Vehicles**: Manage vehicle assignments

### Data Management
